## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me

I am a platform and devops engineer with extensive experience in both AWS and Azure public cloud platforms.

My career started as a Java Developer, but I later transitioned to an AIX Administrator with a government agency.

However, I found my true calling as a management consultant working with government client on turn key initiatives in the MENA region.

My public cloud journey started in 2017, and I have become obsessed ever since.
