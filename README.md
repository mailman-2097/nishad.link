## 🚀 Operational Guides

### Creating blog posts

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. 

Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.

### Publishing posts

This blog utlises a complete Gitops lifecycle.

Create a feature branch `blog/n/blogslug`

Review your changes by using a spell checker and preview your markdown script

Push your code and create a pull or merge request. 

A pipeline will run and give you a staging url to review your changes.

Once QA is complete; merge the pull request.

_Take care to `squash and merge` the pull request. Also, delete the feature branch when you are done._
